language models (LLMs).\\nLangChain simplifies every stage of the LLM application lifecycle:\\n\\nDevelopment: Build your applications using LangChain\\'s open-source components and third-party integrations.\\nUse LangGraph to build stateful agents with first-class streaming and human-in-the-loop support.\\nProductionization: Use LangSmith to inspect, monitor and evaluate your applications, so that you can continuously optimize and deploy with confidence.\\nDeployment: Turn your LangGraph applications into production-ready APIs and Assistants with LangGraph Platform.\\n\\n\\n\\nLangChain implements a standard interface for large language models and related\\ntechnologies, such as embedding models and vector stores, and integrates with\\nhundreds of providers.
